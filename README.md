Project Summary: Hotel Booking Analysis

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data for City Hotel and Resort Hotel to address a key business challenge: high cancellation rates. These cancellations have led to decreased revenue and suboptimal room utilization for both hotels. By exploring cancellation rates and examining influential factors such as booking channels, seasonal demand, pricing, and guest demographics, we aim to provide actionable insights to help reduce cancellations and improve hotel performance.

#Business Problem In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address this problem. The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

#Research Question What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations? How can we make hotel reservations cancellations better? How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

#Hypothesis More cancellations occur when prices are higher. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently. The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of booking trends and cancellation patterns, enabling hotels to adjust their strategies to boost revenue and enhance operational efficiency. With these findings, hotels can make targeted decisions to attract and retain guests while minimizing cancellations.
